## General

### Style / details

* Types with names ending in "Opts" (or "Opt", if they only contain a
  single option) are types directly taking options from humans, either
  via the command line (`Clap`) or config files (`serde`).
  
  Sometimes they are used by the application as is. Sometimes they are
  verified and translated before use; the types they are translated to
  are *not* using names ending in "Opts" (but rather, generally,
  "Options").
  
  Types holding configuration that is generated by the program are
  using names generally or often ending in "Options", but never "Opts".

* When using `Arc` (e.g. for some parts that come from the config,
  which has convoluted life times due to reloading of the config at
  runtime), use `clone_arc()` (from `src/utillib/arc.rs`) to clone it,
  for clarity and easy searching when interested where it happens.
