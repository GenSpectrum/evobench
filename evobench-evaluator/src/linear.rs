//! Run-time "linear types"--warning in the `Drop` implementation in
//! release builds, panic in debug builds. Attempts at using the idea
//! of panicking in const does not work in practice (it appears that
//! drop templates are instantiated before being optimized away, hence
//! e.g. returning them in `Result::Ok` is not possible since it
//! apparently unconditionally instantiates the drop for Result which
//! instantiates the drop for the Ok value even if never used, but I
//! did not manage to analyze the binary to detect drop use after the
//! optimizer either).

//! Only token types are supported: embedding such a token type inside
//! a larger data structure makes the larger data structure run-time
//! checked for linearity, too. That type then has to provide a moving
//! method or function that throws away the linear token by calling
//! `bury()` on it. With that approach, no wrapper around the
//! containing data structure is needed, which might be cleaner?

//! Original idea and partially code came from
//! https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/undroppable/ and
//! https://geo-ant.github.io/blog/2024/rust-linear-types-use-once/,
//! but again, doesn't appear to work in practice. There are also some
//! other crates going the runtime route, maybe the most-used one
//! being <https://crates.io/crates/drop_bomb>.

//! Calling `std::mem::leak` (even on a containing data structure)
//! by-passes the linearity.  It is recommended to only ever use the
//! `bury()` method to get rid of a linear token, and reserve the use
//! of `std::mem::forget` for other purposes, so that searching the
//! code base for it will still just show up actual potential memory
//! leaks as well as potential improper bypasses of the linearity:
//! `forget` on an enclosing data structure bypasses the check and can
//! be done for any data type; whereas `bury()` is only available to
//! the code declaring the linear token type, hence under the control
//! of the library.
