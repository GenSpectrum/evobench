//! Clean up files via `Drop` action. Unlike what the `tempfile`
//! offers, can clean paths that we didn't open ourselves, and specify
//! any path.

//! Relying on `Drop` means that kill by e.g. signals without handlers
//! (ctl-c) will prevent the cleanup. (TODO?: idea as remedy: fork off
//! a daemon in a new session, send it the paths to delete when the
//! pipe to it closes.)
